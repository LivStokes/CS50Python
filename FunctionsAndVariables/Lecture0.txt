# Week 0 of CS50x Lectures.

## Introduction
Writing the first python script of the course.
- In a file called hello.py write print("hello, world.")
    How to make file:
    - In the terminal where I want the file to be located, print $code hello.py 
    How to run the command:
    - Compile through interpreter (translates code to binary for computer to understand) - $python hello.py
    - This should print hello, world to the terminal.

## Functions
Functions gets computer to do things.
- Print() is a function.
Arguments are inputs to the function.
- Printf("hello") the hello is an argument.

Debugging is great with print(). It shows where various bugs are in the code. E.g. prints out what value is in a variable at the given time like in a loop.
Commenting code is also very important. Its great for things like pseudocode or going through thoughts. It helps structure.

# Is a comment in python for lines.
""" Is also a comment in python for blocks. 

Example of a python script in hello.py.

Line of text for python documentation for the print function:
- print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, Flush=False)
What does this line do?
- * = all.
- objects = Gets the objects and prints them.
- sep = What i want to seperated it by.
- end = What the line ends with. 
- \n is new line.
- File and flush arguments control where message goes and when it actually shows up.
file = What file I want the message to go to.
    - sys.stdout is the users standard output/terminal.
Flush = The setting for when the message gets released.
    - If False, it waits till the buffer is full or the progamm is finished before dumping the text to the destination.
    - If Treue, it forces the buffer to empty immediatly.
