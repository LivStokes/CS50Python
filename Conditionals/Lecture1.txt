# Conditionals
- What are cibdutuibals?
Conditionals are the conditions that you give variables.

```
> greater than
>= greater or equal than
< less than
<= less or equal than
== equal to
!= not equal to
```

if conditions:
- Do not take parenthesis.
- Will check if the condition is a boolean true or false and then inside the function is where you want the statement to take action.

else conditions:

elif conditions:


```
score = int(intput("Score: "))

if 90 <= score <= 100:
    print("Grade: A")
elif 80 <= score < 90:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```
