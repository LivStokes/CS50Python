## Introduction
Writing the first python script of the course.
- In a file called hello.py write print("hello, world.")
    How to make file:
    - In the terminal where I want the file to be located, print $code hello.py 
    How to run the command:
    - Compile through interpreter (translates code to binary for computer to understand) - $python hello.py
    - This should print hello, world to the terminal.

## Functions
Functions gets computer to do things.
It is writing things that take inputs and produce outputs.
- Print() is a function.
Arguments are inputs to the function.
- Printf("hello") the hello is an argument.

Debugging is great with print(). It shows where various bugs are in the code. E.g. prints out what value is in a variable at the given time like in a loop.
Commenting code is also very important. Its great for things like pseudocode or going through thoughts. It helps structure.

- # Is a comment in python for lines.
- """ Is also a comment in python for blocks. 

Example of a python script in hello.py:
Line of text for python documentation for the print function:
- print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, Flush=False)
What does this line do?
- * = all.
- objects = Gets the objects and prints them.
- sep = What i want to seperated it by.
- end = What the line ends with. 
- \n is new line.
- File and flush arguments control where message goes and when it actually shows up.
file = What file I want the message to go to.
    - sys.stdout is the users standard output/terminal.
Flush = The setting for when the message gets released.
    - If False, it waits till the buffer is full or the progamm is finished before dumping the text to the destination.
    - If Treue, it forces the buffer to empty immediatly.

How to write use interactive mode in python.
You dont have to keep running python in a file you can access it through the terminal.
It executes commands interactively:
- Simply write python in the terminal.
- It will then show >>> In the terminal for you to execute commands.
- Writes prompts, line by line.
With this python interactive mode, you can use it as a calculator, or to print things and more.

In python scripts in a .py file,
When using calculations on x and y, python sees everthing as strings. So it is important to include (int).
E.g.
x + y will concatenate string numbers. int(x) + int(y) will add numbers.

Documentation for round:
Takes as input a number, and then rounds it to the nearest integer.
round(number[, ndigits])
- The first argument is a number, just takes one number.
- [ means that its something optional. e.g. if tyou want to specify the number of digits that you want the round function.
- The second arguments is the number of digits you want to pass to round to.

Key note with Python vs C.
The way they compile is different.
In C, if there are any mistakes in the whole script, when you try compile the file it wont work.
With python, the script will run and execute line by line but then break once the script has an error.

## def
What is def? def is short for define. - You can create and invent your own functions using def.
def hello()
- This defines a function called hello.
How to use def()?
```
def hello()
    print("hello,")

name = input(Whats your name? ")
hello()
print(name)
```

When defining a function, I can then print it out by calling it.
e.g.
```
def main()
    print("hello")
    print("world")
main()
```

What is a side effect?
